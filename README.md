# VS Code Harpoon

VS Code Harpoon is inspired by The Primeagen's [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
plugin for neovim. It supports the basic use case of file navigation just like with Harpoon.

## Features

VSCode Harpoon is a file navigation tool, which lets you mark editors and jump to your marked
editors.

When adding your first editor, it will be set as `editor 1`, the next `editor 2` and so on.

You are then able to jump to `editor 1` or `editor 2` from anywhere in your workspace.
